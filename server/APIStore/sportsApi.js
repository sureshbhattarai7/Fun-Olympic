        title: 'Mbappe, France players slam police for fatal Paris shooting',
        date: 'June 28, 2023',
        description: `Kylian Mbappe and other prominent France internationals have expressed their indignation after the death of a 17-year-old delivery driver who was shot and killed during a police check in a Paris suburb.

        The killing of the teenager, identified as Na√´l M., prompted nationwide concern and widespread messages of indignation and condolences, and French president Emmanuel Macron called the young man's death "inexplicable and inexcusable."
        
        It also triggered unrest in multiple towns around Paris. Interior Minister G√©rald Darmanin said 31 people were arrested, 25 police officers injured and 40 cars burned in overnight unrest.
        
        "I hurt for my France," Mbappe, who grew up in the Paris suburb of Bondy, wrote Wednesday in a Twitter message accompanied by broken heart emoticons. 
        "Unacceptable situation. All my thoughts go to the family and loved ones of Na√´l, this little angel gone much too soon."
        
        J'ai mal √† ma France. üíôü§çüíîüíîüíî
        Une situation inacceptable.
        Tout mes pens√©es vont pour la famille et les proches de Na√´l, ce petit ange parti beaucoup trop t√¥t.
        
        ‚Äî Kylian Mbapp√© (@KMbappe) June 28, 2023
        
        
        The tensions focused around the suburban area of Nanterre, where lawyers say the teenager was killed Tuesday during a traffic check. The police officer suspected of firing on him was detained and faces potential manslaughter charges, according to the Nanterre prosecutor's office.
        
        The Nanterre neighborhood where Na√´l lived remained on edge Wednesday morning, with police on guard around the regional administration and burned car wreckage and overturned garbage bins still visible in some areas. Bouquets of orange and yellow roses were tied to the post where the car crashed after the shooting, on Nanterre's Nelson Mandela Square.
        
        Na√´l's mother appealed online for a silent march on Thursday in her son's honour, near the scene of his death.
        
        Mike Maignan, another French international player, tweeted about the sense of injustice he felt.
        
        "A bullet in the head...It's always for the same people that being in the wrong leads to death," he wrote. Maignan's France teammate Jules Kounde criticised the media coverage of the teenager's death.
        "As if this latest police blunder wasn't enough, the 24-hour news channels are taking advantage of it by making a big fuss," he wrote. "The 'journalists' ask 'questions' with the sole aim of distorting the truth, criminalizing the victim and finding extenuating circumstances where none exist.
        
        "An age-old method for masking the real problem. Why don't we turn off the TV and find out what's going on?"

        Darmanin said 1,200 police were deployed overnight and 2,000 would be out in force Wednesday in the Paris region and around other big cities to "maintain order."
        
        Videos purported to be of the incident were "extremely shocking," Darmanin said, pledging a full investigation. The images show two police officers leaning into the driver's side window of a yellow car before the vehicle pulls away as one officer fires into the window. The car is later seen crashed into a post nearby.
        
        Deadly use of firearms is less common in France than in the United States. Tuesday's death unleashed anger in Nanterre and other towns, including around housing projects where many residents struggle with poverty and discrimination and feel police abuse is under-punished.
        
        A lawyer for Na√´l's family, Yassine Bouzrou, told The Associated Press they want the police officer pursued for murder instead of manslaughter and want the investigation handed to a different region because they fear Nanterre investigators won't be impartial.
        
        The lawyers rebutted a reported statement by the police that their lives were in danger because the driver had threatened to run them over.
        
        The government will hold a security meeting Wednesday afternoon to discuss next steps, Darmanin said.
        
        The victim was wounded by a gunshot and died at the scene, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. A passenger in the car was briefly detained and released, and police are searching for another passenger, who fled.
        
        Several people have died or sustained injuries at the hands of French police in recent years, prompting demands for more accountability. France also saw protests against racial profiling and other injustice in the wake of George Floyd's killing by police in Minnesota.`,

        title: 'Eliud Kipchoge reveals future plans: Racing for Olympic history and the fifth major marathon star',
        date: '28 June, 2023',
        description: `Kipchoge's goal to win all six major marathons hit a snag in April when he placed a surprising sixth at the Boston Marathon. Two months later, the Olympic champion and world record holder has shaken off the disappointment of that race and shifted his focus to becoming the first marathon runner to win three Olympic titles.
        
        Marathon legend Eliud Kipchoge knows the best way to get over disappointment: Make a goal that is even bigger than your last
        
        Kenya's double Olympic champion and marathon world record holder finished a disappointing sixth in the Boston Marathon in April, but has not let that result dampen his spirits. Instead, he has shifted his focus to making Olympic history at Paris 2024 where he will aim to become the first athlete to win three Olympic marathon titles.
        
        "The priority now is to focus on the Olympics and win a third time. The other (challenges) will come later," Kipchoge told AFP at Kaptagat training camp in Kenya.
        
        Kipchoge's current record of two titles puts him alongside other marathon greats, Ethiopia's Abebe Bikila, who won the Olympic marathon in 1960 and 1964, and East Germany's Waldemar Cierpinski, winner at the 1976 and 1980 Games.
        
        Kipchoge is no stranger to making headlines with his bold ambitions. Whether it is breaking world records, becoming the first man to go under the mythical two-hour barrier, or wining Olympic gold ‚Äì twice ‚Äì the Kenyan is eager to show other athletes what is possible.
        
        "I want to be an inspiration and I trust my breaking the world record twice is an inspiration to many young people," Kipchoge said of his training partners. "I trust they will want more and even beat my records."
        
        One of the qualities that makes Kipchoge such a tough opponent is his ability to bounce back from disappointments. His reaction to the sixth-place finish in the 2023 Boston Marathon is proof of that.
        
        The running legend was making his debut appearance in the event having won 15 out of the 18 sanctioned marathons he had raced. And he started at a good pace, but 30 kilometres into the run, his upper left leg started to hurt. Instead of pulling out, Kipchoge made the decision to slow to a comfortable pace "just to finish", he revealed later at a press conference. In the end, he finished the race in 2:09:23, which is the slowest marthon time in his career. A day after the race, however, Kipchoge was already looking beyond the disappointing results.
        
        ‚ÄúYesterday is a canceled check,‚Äù he said at a press conference. ‚ÄúToday is cash. Tomorrow is a promissory note. Let us forget about the canceled checks. Let us talk of the cash and the promissory notes.‚Äù
        
        Two months later, the athlete reflected again on that spring day and how he moved past it.
        
        ‚ÄúI was really a huge disappointment when you flash back to everything you have been doing for some months. But the beauty of sport is that today you are up and tomorrow you are down," Kipchoge told Citius Mag at a training camp in Kenya. "After sixth place in Boston, I just relaxed, sat at the table and went back to try and think of what has happened.‚Äù`,

        date: '29 June, 2023',
        description: `Joining the Great Britain team as its youngest athlete last year, 18-year-old Healey has already won the nation two Olympic quotas and is hoping to make her Olympic debut at Paris 2024.
        
        British archer Penny Healey has one up on a Disney princess who inspired her to take up archery.
        
        While Princess Merida of the 2012 film Brave has perfect aim and can fight off enchanted bears, she has yet to win her nation a quota at an Olympic Games.
        
        Healey accomplished that feat by winning the gold medal in the women‚Äôs individual recurve at the 2023 European Games in Krakow. The British athlete was unbeaten in the final, with her opponent, Spain's Elia Canales, only succeeding to tie two sets. The gold medal match ended in the fourth set with Healey claiming an early 6-2 victory.
        
        If the British Olympic Association chooses Healey to represent the nation at Paris 2024, it would be the 18-year-old's first Olympic appearance.
        
        ‚ÄúI always had in mind I wanted to go to the Olympics one day, and now it has turned into that I can actually go to the Olympics,‚Äù Healey told Olympics.com before the 2023 European Games.
        
        ‚ÄúI hope I can achieve an Olympic medal. That would be huge for me, as well as becoming world champion this year. That would mean so much to me and obviously it is earlier in my career, so a lot more could happen.‚Äù
        
        Earlier in the day, Italy's Chiara Rebagliati faced Ukraine‚Äôs Anastasiia Pavlova in the bronze medal match with the Italian taking three sets to secure a 6-4 victory.`,

        title: '2023 Wimbledon preview: Djokovic eyes Open Era record 24th major; Swiatek, Rybakina lead women',
        date: '28 June, 2023',
        description: `Novak Djokovic can surpass Serena Williams in modern tennis for most Grand Slams won, with world No.1 Carlos Alcaraz in his way. Top seed Iga Swiatek chases fifth major.
        
        At age 36, Novak Djokovic has made his intentions clear: He's playing for the record books.
        
        The Serbian legend has the chance to write more tennis history at Wimbledon, beginning on Monday (3 July), the sport's historic grass court major held on the grounds of the All England Lawn & Tennis Club.
        
        Djokovic won his 23rd Grand Slam earlier this month at Roland-Garros, equalling Serena Williams at that mark, an Open Era (since 1968) record. A 24th would give him the all-out lead in modern times and also tie the all-time record.
        
        His biggest challenger appears to be Spanish sensation Carlos Alcaraz, who reclaimed the world No.1 ranking last weekend with his first-ever grass title when he triumphed at Queen's Club.
        
        A host of other men stand in their way, including top four seeds Daniil Medvedev and Casper Ruud, as well as 2022 runner-up Nick Kyrgios.
        
        On the women's side, world No.1 Iga Swiatek is fresh off her fourth major - and third Paris title since 2020 at the French Open. But she's just 5-3 at Wimbledon in her career, having never advanced to the quarter-finals.
        
        Surprise 2022 champ Elena Rybakina will look to re-capture her grass court magic from a year ago, while this year's Australian Open winner Aryna Sabalenka rounds out the women's top trio that some have called the WTA's 'Big 3.'
        
        While Rafael Nadal remains out until 2024, former champions here and Olympic gold medallists Andy Murray and Venus Williams are both set to hit the singles court.
        
        While it's Alcaraz who re-claimed the world No.1 ranking with his Wimbledon warm-up win, Djokovic is clearly the man to beat: He's won 28 consecutive matches at The Championships, dating back to 2017, and boasts a 86-10 record overall at the event, more than the rest of the ATP's top 20 - combined.
        
        For the second time in three years he's halfway to the calendar Grand Slam - all four majors in one year - having won at Wimbledon in 2021, as well. "I'm writing my own history," he said after his win in Paris a few weeks ago, shrugging off historical comparisons to Nadal and the now-retired Roger Federer.
        
        Jannik Sinner took Djokovic to five sets here a year ago, but has not been at his peak form in recent months. Nor have previous runners-up Kyrgios (2022) or Matteo Berrettini (2021), who both continue to face a spell of injuries.`,

        date: 'June 28, 2023',
        description: `Let's move! You've heard it from your parents. You may have heard it from your friends, colleagues, coaches, and loved ones too.

        On Olympic Day 2023, the world‚Äôs best athletes are joining the conversation to get you moving.
        
        We asked Olympic champions, Olympians, and Olympic hopefuls to share how you can make exercise a part of your daily routine while loving every minute of it, whether you‚Äôre a fan of the outdoors or prefer to exercise under a roof, whether you like summer or winter, light yoga or heavy barbells.
        
        "Exercise for your body is very, very important," Indian badminton player and two-time Olympic medallst P.V. Sindhu told Olympics.com. "Being an athlete, we do regular exercise for so many hours but I think for the people out there, I would (hope) that this campaign will inspire a lot of them. I hope each one of them will come out and do some sort of exercise and that way they can keep themselves healthy."
        
        Moroccan taekwondo athlete Nada Laaraj rewards herself for her training sessions - sometimes as many as three per day - with a trip to the beach on the Cote d‚ÄôAzur. For South African surfer Sarah Baum, who spends most of her day on the beach, the reward can be something as simple as a tasty morning beverage.
        
        "We all have those moments for sure, when I'm like, 'Oh, I don't want to get out of bed'," Baum told Olympics.com. "So you can always just give yourself an incentive if you get up and do your exercise, if it's stretching, going for a walk or run, whatever it is. If you drink coffee, you go, 'OK, I can have a coffee after that', or 'I can have a fruit juice or something'."
        
        Sarah Baum's top healthy habits: "Don't forget to drink lots of water. Make sure that you're eating right and clean and not much alcohol. You can have a little bit of alcohol, but not too much. Make sure you're eating the right foods. Definitely exercise. Just getting up and going for a walk, it doesn't have to be anything crazy. A walk down the road is is all you need. A good sleep. Technology can can keep you awake and keep the brain moving, so just putting your phone down 45 minutes before you go to sleep."
        
        As an outdoor athlete, French canoeist Maxime Beaumont is not only dealing with early morning alarms but also fickle weather. Motivation to go paddling can hit rock bottom when it is raining or snowing, but the Olympic silver medallist has found a way to shift his perspective.
        
        "I won't hide this from you. There are days in the winter, when it's zero degrees, when it snows. It's not always easy to pick up the paddle and the boat," Beaumont told Olympics.com. "But I always try to find the positive side. I try to find something positive in the session. OK, the weather isn't good, but it will allow me to work on something. For example, if there is wind and waves because it is winter, that will allow me to train for difficult conditions. We are doing an outdoor sport so it is possible that in August there will be a lot of wind and waves, and so this will allow me to train for the day of competition when it will be complicated."
        
        Maxime Beaumont's top healthy habits: "A very good, varied lunch but consistent with doing sports during the day. A little bit of flexibility during the day, a little stretching, a little mobility, that can be yoga, pilates, or just stretching. See people. Whether it's in training, but also in social life, not to be closed in on yourself. Discuss, talk with people, be open, also be curious about a lot of things. And last point, have a good sleep, full nights where we go to bed not late. If possible, have a little nap. It's not always possible, but if you can take a nap at 12 p.m., that's the best."`,

        description: `Cho Daeseong moves on to round 4 of qualifying after successfully pulling off a comeback against Benedek Olah in the Men‚Äôs Singles at WTT Contender Zagreb 2023. Deaseong continues his bid for a spot in the main draw after a 3-2 victory (10-12, 5-11, 11-5, 11-6, 11-3).

        Cho raced to an early 6-3 lead early in the first game, before Olah began to use his reverse pendulum service more effectively, causing his opponent to make errors on the forehand side. In the second, things only got worse for the Korea Republic athlete. Olah was playing hyper aggressively, showing off his monstrous backhand and forehand flick, to take the last five points of game two in a row to take a storming 2-0 lead.
        
        Adjustment was needed. Cho changed up his tactics, serving shorter to prevent the World No.84 from going on the attack and using his backhand flick to force Olah into mistakes. This led him to win five of the final six points to take game three.
        
        From that point on, Daeseong remained in control, and despite being more than 30 rankings lower at World No.119, did not crumble and took out the match.
        
        Standing in Daeseong‚Äôs path of getting into the main draw is World No.130 Lilian Bardet, who is coming off a career best win against World No.60 Sathiyan Gnanasekaran.
        
        But Daeseong was not the only underdog to claim victory, as Manush Utpalbhai Shah defeated Xue Fei 3-2 (11-8, 11-4, 8-11, 5-11, 11-9).
        
        Despite being 79 lower on the global ladder than his opponent at World No.147, Shah was unphased and took out a monumental upset.
        
        Using his backhand flick to cause his opponent into difficult positions, Shah played a brilliant match against one of the world‚Äôs strongest penholders.
        
        Now, he faces the blocking master Lam Siu Hang for a spot in the main draw, meaning he will once again have to overcome a rankings deficit, but after the performance in round 3 of qualification, anything is possible for Shah now.`,

        Instead, the No. 1 pick of the Draft will join the team in Las Vegas ahead of the July 7 Summer League opener against the Charlotte Hornets.
        
        It‚Äôs expected Wembanyama will make his NBA Summer League debut against the Hornets and No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller.
        
        Spurs coach Gregg Popovich predicted after the NBA Draft that the team might ease Wembanyama into the Summer League schedule given his recent workload playing in the LNB Pro A French League. Wembanyama just finished a season leading the Boulogne-Levallois Metropolitans 92s to the LNB Pro A Finals, playing 34 games while averaging 21.6 points and 10.2 rebounds playing 32 minutes per game.
        
        ‚ÄúHe never stopped playing,‚Äù Popovich said after the Draft. ‚ÄúHe will participate in the summer league. To what degree, we are not exactly sure yet.‚Äù
        
        It‚Äôs expected Wembanyama will make two appearances at the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. In addition to giving its prized first-round pick somewhat of a break, San Antonio hopes to use the time spent away from the Summer League squad to get Wembanyama acclimated to his new teammates that will play more prominent roles this upcoming season.

(An oddity from the B final: Lithuanian sprint breaststroker Ruta Meilutyte went 25.19 to tie for 13th; she was within .15 of the national record she owns in that event.)
        
        Ceccon nearly downed his Italian record in the men‚Äôs 50 butterfly, clocking in at 22.84 to win. He holds the national mark at 22.79 from the 2022 World Championships.
        
        His time bested Szebasztian Szabo of Hungary by a quarter second. Szabo went 23.13. Noe Ponti was third in 23.27, followed by Nyls Korstanje (23.36) and Ben Proud (23.45).
        
        Switzerland‚Äôs Roman Mityukov led the way in the men‚Äôs 200 backstroke at 1:56.56. That‚Äôs within .34 of the national mark he set at Euros a year ago.
        
        Hidekazu Takehara of Japan finished second in 1:57.57. Britain‚Äôs Brodie Williams and Cameron Brooker were the only two others to break two minutes.
        
        Kylie Masse delivered a composed and controlled swim to win the women‚Äôs 200 back. The Canadian was ahead at every wall in holding off Katie Shanahan to win in 2:08.91. Shanahan split 31.93 on the final 50, the only sub-33 split heading home, to grab second in 2:09.69. She passed Rio Shirai on that final lap, the Japanese swimmer third in 2:10.23.
        
        Boglarka Kapas won the women‚Äôs 200 fly in 2:08.52, eight tenths clear of the field. She was ninth at the 100-meter mark and fifth entering the final 50 but roared home in 32.34 to rally past the field. Laura Stephens held on to third in 2:09.32, a tenth up on Dalma Sebestyen. Greece‚Äôs Georgia Damasioti beat a crowd to finish fourth, while Italian Ilaria Cusinato, the leader after 150 meters, slipped to sixth.
        
        Arno Kamminga booked another win in the 200 breast in a time of 2:10.57. He was up at every wall and steadily pulled away from Erik Persson, Luca Pizzini and Alessandro Fusco, all of whom clustered within three tenths in the 2:11s. Kamminga‚Äôs time was well short of the meet record 2:07.63 he set in 2021.
        
        Tes Schouten continued a stellar spring by winning the 200 breast, a tenth slower than the Dutch record she authored earlier this month. Schouten‚Äôs 2:21.84 was exactly two seconds ahead of runner-up Reona Aoki.
        
        Schouten was re-written the Dutch recordboard this spring, going 2:22.21 in April and 2:21.71 this month at the Dutch Championships.
        
        Francesca Fangio and Martina Carraro were third and fourth, respectively, for Italy.
        
        Simona Quadarella got a win for the home country in a stirring battle with Valentine Dumont. Quadarella touched first in 4:05.85, using a split of 29.26 over the final 50 to unseat the Belgian, who led all the way to that point.
        
        Dumont got a pretty consolation prize, her time of 4:06.27 lowering her national record for the second time this year. Dumont, who turns 23 next week, had set the Belgian mark at Sette Colli in 2020 at 4:09.41, then went 4:08.81 at Mare Nostrum last month. She‚Äôs now skipped the 4:07s entirely and nearly jumped out of the 4:06s, too.
        
        Hungary‚Äôs Anja Kesely held close the entire way, going 4:06.41 for third. Italy‚Äôs Antonietta Cesarano and Portugal‚Äôs Francisca Martins also broke 4:10 (Martins set a national record of 4:08.77 last month at Mare Nostrum).
        
        Alberto Razzetti topped Duncan Scott in a battle in the men‚Äôs 200 IM. Razzetti used a stellar breaststroke leg to just hold off Scott‚Äôs charge in freestyle by .09 seconds, the Italian winning in 1:58.74. Scott was more than a second clear of the rest of the chasers in 1:58.83. Ron Polonsky of Israel was third in 2:00.04, .11 up on Scott‚Äôs countryman Max Litchfield.
        
        Sara Franceschi continued Italy‚Äôs hot streak by going 2:09.30 to win the women‚Äôs 200 IM and lower her national record in the process. Her breaststroke split of 36.80, eight tenths better than anyone else, proved decisive. She edged Marrit Steenbergen of the Netherlands by two tenths, in 2:09.51. Third place went to Katie Shanahan in 2:10.93, with her fellow Brit Abbie Wood fifth. In between was Anita Gastaldi.
        
        Luca De Tullio capped the meet by winning the men‚Äôs 1,500 free. The Italian chugged past Irishman Daniel Wiffen on the final 100, after Wiffen had gone in front around the 550-meter mark. De Tullio got under 15 minutes at 14:59.68. Wiffen grabbed silver in 15:02.51. Third was Frenchman Damien Joly in 15:03.61, ahead of Ivan Giovannoni.`,
